# Water_Problem_Project

### Project Overview
We'll be investigating the access to afffordable drinking water. Part 1 of the project is about understaning the data and part 2 is about transforming the data.

### Data Source
- Part 1: Estimate on the use of water (2020) dataset.

Note that the two dataset will not be available here, due to copywrite issues.

### Tools 
- Advanced excel - Understanding and trasforming the data

### Part 1: Understaning the data 
- Step 1: **Becoming familiar with the dataset:** We had a look at the different features and definitions of this dataset.
- Step 2: **Importing the data:** In order to investigate the data, we need to import our data, ensuring that it is properly separated into columns and rows.
- Step 3: **Investigating population size:** We had to summarise the national population size to better understand how the dataset represents the entire world population and create new features.
- Step 4: **Investigating access by area:** We had to investigate what access to water at the different service levels looks like for people in specific types of areas (national,urban, and rural)  and create new features.
- Step 5: **Investigating access by population size:** We had to investigate what access to water at the different service levels looks like for different population sizes  and create new features.
- Step 6: **Investigating access by income group:** We want to investigate the relationship between GNI (gross national income) or income group, population size, urbanisation, and national water access  and create new features.

### Part 2: Transforming the data and creating report called Global 2020 report
- Step 1 and Step 2 are the same as part 1.
- Step 3: **Investigating population size:** A summary of the dataset population size and estimated world population, which includes urban percentage share and the percentage difference between all of the features. A line chart of the national population versus the urban and rural population shares.
- Step 4: **Investigating access by area:** The maximum, minimum, mean, mode, median, first and third quartiles, the interquartile
range, and the standard deviation for each of the 12 water access features. A box and whisker plot for all 12 water access features.
- Step 5: **Investigating access by population size:** Three 100% stacked column charts, one each for national, rural, and urban population size or
percentage versus the four different service levels.
- Step 6:  **Investigating access by income group:** A pivot table for income group versus the sum of the national population and the averages for the urban population, basic, limited, unimproved, and surfaceaccess shares. A visualisation (of choice) for income group versus the different average shares in the created pivot table.

### Findining/Results
10 findings from water problem project:

1. What is the percentage difference between the dataset and the estimated world urban population size (the total number of people
living in urban areas) for 2020?

2. True or false? Based on the national population versus urban and rural share visualisation, where the x-axis is the aggregated
national population size and the y-axis is the population share in percentage, the average population shares across all population
sizes are approximately 50% because the chart lines fluctuate equally above and below the 50% line.

3. True or false? The distribution of the national basic service feature (wat_bas_n) is more similar to the distribution of the urban
basic feature (wat_bas_u) than it is to the national limited feature (wat_lim_n).

4. What is the interquartile range of the rural surface service feature, wat_sur_r?

5.
